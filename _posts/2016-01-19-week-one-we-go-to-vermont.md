Hello,

This is the first of 52 installments in which we transport ourselves somewhere across the world and try to experience that place through their news. We're starting in Vermont. Why Vermont?

1. 30 percent of people in Vermont lack broadband Internet. [source](http://digital.vpr.net/post/under-new-fcc-standard-30-percent-vermonters-now-lack-broadband)

1. Vermont is the second least populous state in the country. Burlington, its largest city, is the least populous largest city within a state in the United States.

1. As of 2011, Vermont Public Radio was the No. 2 public radio station in the nation for percentage per capita of listeners; the first was in Washington, D.C. (2011, Vermont Business Journal)

1. 120,000 people subscribe to an online community called the [Front Porch Forum.](http://digital.vpr.net/post/front-porch-forum-pleased-breaking-even-has-no-out-state-plans#stream/0) which [operates statewide](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/03/07/391269248/in-vermont-a-hyper-local-online-forum-brings-neighbors-together).

1. People love Vermont enough to write a theme song](http://music.metafilter.com/6796/251-Towns) about its 251 towns.

1. One out of six people in Vermont receive SNAP benefits. 40 percent of school children in Vermont are eligible for free lunches. The poverty rate is the highest its been in 20 years.

Vermont's an interesting state. Outside of the county that houses Burlington, news travels mainly via newspaper, word of mouth, and newsletter. I was repeatedly told that to dig into Vermont, I had to leave Burlington.

I tried to do that — though I'm sure I'm missing quite a bit.

**Things I did this week to learn more about the news in Vermont.**

1. Asked you to reach out to people you knew in the state of Vermont and ask them a series of questions about how they got their news. A number of you did, including:



1. Listened to [Rumble Strip Vermont](http://www.rumblestripvermont.com/), a really great podcast about ordinary Vermonters. The host, Erica Heilman, "invites herself into Vermonters’ homes to find out what they know, what they hate, who they love, what they’re afraid of, and what makes them more like you than you’d realized." Start with [this one](http://www.rumblestripvermont.com/2015/02/police-log/) about Barre's police log.

1. Interviewed Sara Simon, the web developer at Vermont Public Radio, about the [sewage bot](http://www.poynter.org/2016/you-can-steal-sara-simons-sewage-bot-and-everything-else-she-makes/391155/) she created.

1. She led me to Taylor Dobbs, the digital reporter for the station, who recommended I read his [curated collection of Vermont-related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/taylordobbs/m/vermont) on the website Reddit.

1. From there, I learned that Murphy the golden retriever was [recently reunited with his family](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/01/16/lostdog/ftOO5laBN89EyI8JlOCg3M/story.html) in Waterbury, VT after going missing for 19 months. I also learned that Vermont's workforce size has [not grown in a decade](http://www.vtfuturesproject.org/economic-dashbboard/).

1. I learned that if you want to follow Vermont-specific news on Twitter, use the hashtag #VTpoli for political news and #BTV for Burlington-centric stuff. (h/t **Taylor Dobbs**)

1. And I read and listened. This is some of what I consumed, though this list is not comprehensive:

[Is Vermont the whitest state in the union?](http://vtdigger.org/2016/01/17/is-vermont-the-whitest-state-in-the-union/) from the VT Digger, a statewide news website that publishes watchdog reports on state government and politics.

[The Link Between Pain Management And Opiate Abuse](http://digital.vpr.net/post/link-between-pain-management-and-opiate-abuse#stream/0) from Vermont Public Radio

[Unpacking A Big Week In Vermont Politics](http://digital.vpr.net/post/unpacking-big-week-vermont-politics#stream/0) also from VPR.

[How Three Vermont Media Companies Keep the Presses Rolling](http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/how-three-vermont-media-companies-keep-the-presses-rolling/Content?oid=2627304) from Seven Days.

[Vermont Digital Newspaper Project](http://library.uvm.edu/vtnp/)

Ongoing Bernie Sanders coverage from [Seven Days](http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/bernie-beat/Category?oid=2428243) and [VT Digger](http://vtdigger.org/bernies-bid/) and [Vermont Public Radio](http://digital.vpr.net/term/bernie-sanders).
