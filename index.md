	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I design and then build tools and/or strategies that help organizations reach new audiences or think about audiences in different ways.</p>
	<p>I currently work on <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/team/melody/">lots of different projects</a> at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government. I also write <a href="http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute and lead <a href="http://www.mediapublic.io">Media Public</a>, a public media startup that's funded through a Knight Prototype Grant.
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, exploring small towns in North Carolina, and hanging out with A and our dog Sadie.</p>
